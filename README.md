## CheckMate's Front End Engineer Coding Challenge

One of the coolest parts of CheckMate's product is a direct message platform that lets guests and hotels communicate directly to each other via SMS and email.  

Today we're going to build an Apple iMessage clone.

### User Stories:
* As a User, I should enter my name when I first open the application in order to identify myself amongst all chat members.
* As a User, I should see my messages on the right side and messages from other users on the left side in order to differentiate my messages amongst others.
* As a User, I should be able to send a message at the bottom of the interface to all members of the chat in order to communicate with everyone in realtime.
* As a User, I should see a list of all messages in chronological order in the chat.
* As a User, I should see a list of all users in the chat.

### Phase One (15-20 minutes)
We'd like you to first whiteboard the layout/design. __Break out the user stories into iterations and work out how you will tackle each iteration__.

### Phase Two (1.5-2 hours)
Start building!  We'll let you choose how to build it.  Want to use a javascript or css framework? Want to use Firebase or SocketIO? Go for it! 

### Retrospective (20-30 minutes)
Let's talk about what you built and how you got there.
