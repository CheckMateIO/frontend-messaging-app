## CheckMate's Front End Engineer Coding Challenge

One of the coolest parts of CheckMate's product is a direct message platform that let's guests and hotels communicate directly to each other via SMS and email.  Today we're going to build a simplified messaging program that will let a guest message a hotel directly.

### Features:
* There is a single shared channel used by all connected chat clients (no rooms needed).
* When a new chat participant visits the application they should be asked to provide a (required) screen name.  There is no real signup/login requirement.
* After providing a screen name, they are dropped into the shared chat room where they can see a list of other active/connected clients with their screen name and when they last sent a message.
* The chat interface should show messages from me on the right side and messages from other users on the left side very similar to iMessage or FB Messenger orâ€¦ pretty much any chat client.
* Each message should indicate who sent the message and when it was sent.
* There should be a UI element at the bottom of the chat interface to send a new message.
* All messages should be pushed in real time to all connected clients and displayed in their chat interface as appropriate.
* The UI is pretty much up to you!

### Phase One (15-20 minutes)
We'd like you to first whiteboard the layout/design that you think you'll build.

### Phase Two (1.5-2 hours)
Start building!  We'll let you choose how to build it.  Want to use a javascript or css framework? Go for it!

### Retrospective (20-30 minutes)
Let's talk about what you built and how you got there.
